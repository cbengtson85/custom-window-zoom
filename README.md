# Custom Window Zoom

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to set the zoom level increment/decrement level.  By default VSCode increments/decrements by '1' which equates to ~20%.  

With this extension you can set the user settings, window.zoomLevel, to any decimal and the increment/decrement action will increase by whatever you set it to.  

For Example, set zoom level to .1, if you zoom in it will be .2 and if you zoom out it would be .1 again.

Current keybindings are set to cmd+9 to zoom in and cmd+8 to zoom out, windows users use control+8 & 9. Recommended to override the default (cmd-) (cmd=) zoom keybindings.
